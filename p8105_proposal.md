# 1. Group Members:

- Candice Yu (jy3360)
- Yangyang Chen (yc4384)
- Yifei Liu (yl5508)
- Longyu Zhang (lz2951)

# 2. The tentative project title:

A Comprehensive Analysis of Hospital Data on Mortality Rates

# 3. The motivation for this project:

Predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with heart failure
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) remain unclear. Aimed to lay a
solid foundation for Survival Analysis, deepen our understanding of
Mortality, we conducted a comprehensive research based on the patient’s
Mortality factors dataset. Although this dataset belongs to
cross-sectional study, we still can dig out some key patterns that
affect Mortality and detect abnormal characteristics that indicate the
death sign at the early stage.

# 4. The intended final products:

1.  A comprehensive report detailing the findings, including statistical
    analyses and potential clinical implications.
2.  Data visualization of key predictors and their correlation with
    in-hospital mortality.  
3.  Visual graphs that illustrate which features are most influential in
    the prediction model, providing insights into which clinical or
    laboratory markers are the most critical.

# 5. The anticipated data sources:

<https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635>

MIMIC-III (‘Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care’) is a large,
single-center database comprising information relating to patients
admitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital. Data
includes vital signs, medications, laboratory measurements, observations
and notes charted by care providers, fluid balance, procedure codes,
diagnostic codes, imaging reports, hospital length of stay, survival
data, and more.

# 6. The planned analyses/visualization/coding challenges:

### i. Data Analyses:

1.  Most frequent mortality factor in Hospital
2.  Investigating independent risk factors of in-hospital mortality
3.  Obtain the top three biomedical indices that make the most
    significant contributions to the specific disease from the
    dimension-reduction factors mentioned in (b)
4.  for the specific disease, construct a linear model to predict the
    prognosis based on the factors described in (c)

### ii. Data Visualization:

1.  Interactive dashboard showing descriptive statistics of the
    predictors
2.  Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for displaying model
    prediction performance

### iii. Coding challenges:

1.  Data cleaning
2.  Model building
3.  Data visualization
